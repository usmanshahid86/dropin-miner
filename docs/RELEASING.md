# Releasing

A release has two halves, and the line between them is the point of this document.

**Choosing what to release is a human decision.** Which commit becomes `vX.Y.Z` is
decided by a person, recorded by an annotated tag, and pushed deliberately. Nothing
in CI creates, moves or deletes a tag, and nothing merges a release for you.

**Everything after that tag is mechanical, and is now done by `release.yml`.** Building
six binaries, publishing the GitHub Release, checking that the release actually carries
what the npm wrapper will ask for, publishing the wrapper, waiting out the registry, and
installing the published package on three operating systems to watch the binary say its
own version — all of it used to be a checklist, and a checklist is a thing a person
performs correctly right up until the day they don't. `v0.2.1` and `v0.2.2` are what
that looks like: the npm version bump landed a commit late twice running, and nothing
noticed either time.

This process was originally reconstructed from release history rather than documented
prospectively; this file now records the release invariant, the known historical
exceptions, and the automation that enforces the invariant going forward.

## What CI does and does not do

`ci.yml` runs on every push to `main` and every PR: build, test, vet, race,
cross-compile, lint, vuln. It is verification. **It does not release anything, and
merging to `main` does not trigger a release.**

`release.yml` triggers on exactly one thing: pushing a tag matching `v*`. Nothing else
does.

## The human half

1. **Confirm `main` is green.** `ci.yml` passing on `main` is a precondition, not a
   step — if it isn't green, fix that first, don't tag through it.
2. **Merge a dedicated `release/x.y.z` PR** that bumps `npm/package.json`'s `"version"`
   to the target `X.Y.Z` and writes `CHANGELOG.md`'s entry for the release. Its merge
   commit is what gets tagged. The bump is deliberately *not* automated: CI does not
   commit to this repository, and the number belongs in the commit under review rather
   than in a machine's afterthought.
3. **Run the checks under "Before you tag"** on the exact commit you are about to tag.
4. **Tag and push:**

   ```
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" <commit>
   git push upstream vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Annotated (`-a`) is the rule from v0.2.8 on — it records who cut the release and
   when, which a lightweight tag does not — and the workflow now enforces it. The
   earlier tags are mixed (v0.1.1 through v0.1.6 and v0.2.6 annotated; v0.1.7 through
   v0.2.5 and v0.2.7 lightweight) and are left exactly as they are: retagging a
   published release would move refs that `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `npm/install.js`
   and an already-published `checksums.txt` resolve against, for a cosmetic gain.

   The tag carries the `v` prefix always: `release.yml` matches `v*`, and
   `npm/install.js` downloads from `releases/download/v${version}`, so a tag named
   `0.2.0` builds nothing and the npm package of that version can never install.

   The tag goes to `twilight-project/dropin-miner` (the `upstream` remote), where the
   releases live and `install.sh`/`install.ps1`/`npm/install.js` look for them — never
   to `origin`, a fork: a tag pushed only there publishes a release nobody's installer
   can find.
5. **Watch the run**, and read the preflight job's diagnostics even when it passes —
   it prints the tagged commit, canonical main, and the asset names it expects.
6. **Run the `install.ps1` check** below. It is the one acceptance step still done by
   hand, and the workflow does not attempt it.

## Before you tag

These are the checks that have each been bought by a release that shipped without them.
Run them on the commit you are about to tag, not on a branch that resembles it. The
first two are now also enforced by the workflow, which is the point — but a release
that fails preflight is a tag already pushed, and a pushed tag is awkward to take back.

- **`CHANGELOG.md` has a heading for this version**, with its date, and the entry says
  what changed for a participant — not a list of commit subjects. `goreleaser`'s
  auto-generated release notes are the commit-by-commit record; this file is the other
  thing.
- **`npm/package.json`'s `"version"` already says `X.Y.Z`** in the commit you're about
  to tag, or an ancestor of it.
- **The usage text and the installed skill match the flags actually shipped.** A flag
  named in `usageText` or `cmd/dropin-miner/skill.md` that the binary does not accept,
  or a flag it accepts that neither mentions, is the 0.2.6 finding repeating itself:
  the help surface is the contract an agent reads.
- **Any adapter that has never had a live smoke gets one, or the changelog states the
  exception.** Saying "not live-smoked" in the entry is an acceptable answer; saying
  nothing is not. As of v0.2.6 the Pi and Hermes adapters carried that exception.
- **`make verify` is green on that exact commit**, and `ci.yml` is green on `main`.

## The automated half

`release.yml` is five jobs, each depending on the last. The ordering is a dependency
chain rather than a preference: **the npm wrapper carries no binary of its own.** Its
postinstall downloads the GitHub Release's archive for the running platform and verifies
it against `checksums.txt`. So the release must exist, and be complete, before the
wrapper pointing at it is published — and an npm version, once published, cannot be
taken back.

The substantive checks live in `tools/releasecheck`, a small Go program with its own
tests, rather than in shell embedded in the workflow. A release gate nobody can run
except by cutting a release is a gate nobody has tested; every rejection below has a
test that drives it. `tools/releasecheck` is release tooling and not part of the client:
`.goreleaser.yaml` builds `./cmd/dropin-miner` and nothing else, so none of it ships in
the binary, and nothing in `cmd/` or `pkg/` imports it.

Every `uses:` in `release.yml` is pinned to a full commit SHA, with the release it
corresponds to in a trailing comment. A tag like `@v4` is a moving pointer the action's
owner can repoint at any time, and this workflow holds a publishing credential —
"whatever `@v4` means today" is not an acceptable answer for what runs beside it. The
cost is that pins do not update themselves: bumping them is a deliberate PR, and the
comment is there so a reader can see at a glance which release each SHA is. `ci.yml` is
deliberately left on floating tags; it holds no credential and publishes nothing.

### 1. `preflight` — may this tag become a release?

Nothing is built until all of this holds. Every file is read out of the tag with
`git show`, never out of the worktree beside it, because "npm/package.json at the tag"
has to mean the bytes the tag actually carries — a later fix on `main` does not make a
wrong tag right.

- **The ref is `vX.Y.Z`**, exactly. Pre-release and build-metadata suffixes are refused:
  they would sail through goreleaser and publish to npm's `latest` dist-tag, and nothing
  downstream has ever been exercised against one.
- **The tag is annotated**, per the v0.2.8 convention above.
- **The tagged commit is an ancestor of canonical `main`.** Canonical main is fetched
  explicitly into its own ref and named on the command line — never inferred from the
  checkout branch, which on a tag push *is* the tag. This is the security-relevant one:
  a syntactically valid `v*` tag pointing at some commit in the repository is not a
  release, and write access enough to create a tag must not by itself be enough to
  publish a package under this project's name. See "What this assumes about the
  repository" below for the other half of that argument.
- **`npm/package.json` at the tag says `X.Y.Z`.** This is v0.2.1 and v0.2.2, caught.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` at the tag has a `## vX.Y.Z` heading.**
- **`.goreleaser.yaml` and `npm/install.js` name the same assets.** The two are
  independent statements of what a release file is called — goreleaser's
  `name_template` and the wrapper's own string interpolation — and a release is only
  installable while they agree. The expected asset names are *derived from
  `.goreleaser.yaml` at the tag* rather than hard-coded, so a change to the project
  name, the OS or architecture matrix, the archive format overrides or the checksum
  filename changes what is expected; a change the tool does not model (a second build,
  `targets:`, `ignore:`, a template field it cannot resolve) stops the release rather
  than being guessed at.
- **`npm pack ./npm --dry-run` succeeds.** Note the form: `npm --prefix npm pack
  --dry-run` is *not* the same command — `--prefix` sets the install prefix, not the
  pack target, so it reads `package.json` from the repository root and fails with
  ENOENT.

It then asks GitHub whether a release for this tag already exists, and classifies it
`absent`, `complete` or `partial`. That is what makes a rerun safe; see "When something
fails" below.

### 2. `release-binaries` — goreleaser

Unchanged in substance from what this repo has always done: six static binaries
(linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64), each packaged with `LICENSE`, `README.md` and
`scripts/setup.sh`, checksummed into `checksums.txt`, published as a non-draft GitHub
Release whose body is generated from `git log` between tags and opens with a link to
`CHANGELOG.md` at this tag.

This is the only job with `contents: write`, and it is skipped entirely when preflight
classified the release `complete`.

### 3. `verify-release` — read it back

A separate job reads the release from the API and requires it to carry **exactly** the
expected assets: the six archives and `checksums.txt`, no more and no fewer. Missing is
the obvious failure. An *unexpected* asset fails too — it means the release config grew
an artifact kind this check cannot name, and a verifier that shrugs at files it does not
understand is not verifying the release.

Goreleaser exiting zero is not accepted as the answer to "did the release publish", for
the same reason a test asserts on an observable rather than on the fact that a function
was called.

### 4. `publish-npm` — the wrapper

Publishes `npm/` at the version already committed at the tag. Nothing here bumps a
version, commits, or pushes.

`--ignore-scripts` is passed so publication never executes a lifecycle script from the
package while the credential is in the environment. The package's own `postinstall`
still ships and still runs for whoever installs it; only the publish-time hooks are
suppressed.

This is the only job that references the `release` environment and the only one that
can see `NPM_TOKEN`.

### 5. `smoke-npm` — install it for real, on three operating systems

The only release check that has run the released binary. Everything before it compares
one version string to another, and all of those can pass on a release whose published
wrapper downloads the wrong archive.

On Ubuntu, macOS and Windows, each in a genuinely fresh temporary directory:
`npm install dropin-miner@X.Y.Z`, let the package's own postinstall pick the platform
archive, download it from the GitHub Release, verify it against `checksums.txt` and
unpack it, then `npx --no-install dropin-miner version` and require exactly:

```
dropin-miner X.Y.Z
```

The binary name, then the version **without** the `v`. The tag carries the `v`;
`.goreleaser.yaml` injects `-X main.version={{.Version}}`, which goreleaser resolves to
the tag with the prefix stripped. Expecting `vX.Y.Z` here fails a release that is in
fact correct.

`--no-install` is load-bearing: without it `npx` would happily fetch the package itself
and report a version even if the install had produced nothing.

Between the publish and the install there is a **bounded wait** for the registry to
serve the exact version. `v0.2.7` is why: for about twenty seconds after a successful
publish, `npm view` still reported the previous version. A stale first answer is
propagation, not a failed release, so a single immediate lookup is the wrong check. An
answer that never arrives *is* a failure, so the wait is bounded — ten minutes, polled
every ten seconds — and says so when it expires.

**This Windows job does not run `scripts/install.ps1`.** It exercises the npm path on
Windows: ZIP selection, checksum, unpack, and the `.exe` reporting its version. The
`install.ps1` acceptance check below remains manual and separate.

## When something fails

npm publication is irreversible and a tag is awkward to move, so each failure state has
one right answer. A rerun of the workflow never moves the tag, never builds a different
commit, and never invents a version to escape a failure.

**Preflight failed.** Nothing was built and nothing was published. The tag is wrong, or
the commit is. Delete the tag (`git push upstream :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`), fix the problem
on `main`, and tag the new merge commit.

**The GitHub Release succeeded and something after it failed.** Re-run the workflow.
Preflight will classify the release `complete` and goreleaser is skipped — it is not
re-run, because that would replace assets a published npm package may already be
downloading. The run resumes at verification and proceeds to npm.

**The GitHub Release is partial** — some assets uploaded, some did not. The workflow
stops and says which are missing. This one is *not* resumed automatically: re-running
goreleaser over a partial release replaces what did upload, and whether that is safe
depends on whether anything has fetched it yet. Look at the release, delete it and
re-run or repair it by hand, then re-run the workflow.

**npm publish failed.** Re-run. The publish job asks the registry whether
`dropin-miner@X.Y.Z` already exists before attempting anything. If it does not, it
publishes. If it does, it does **not** treat "the version exists" as proof the release
is correct: it downloads the published tarball and compares its contents against `npm/`
at this tag, and only then moves on to the smoke test. A published version whose
contents differ from the tag stops the workflow — nothing is republished, because an npm
version is immutable, and the mismatch is a thing to diagnose rather than paper over.

**The registry never served the version.** The publish step reported success, so this is
a registry or package-state problem. Do not publish again; the version is immutable.

**A smoke install failed.** This is the asymmetric one. **The npm publish has already
happened and cannot be undone**, so the workflow fails loudly and stops, and deliberately
does nothing else: it does not move, delete or recreate the tag, and it does not attempt
to republish. A released package that does not install is a defect to diagnose, and the
next release is the fix. The per-platform matrix does not fail fast, so the run tells you
whether one operating system is broken or all three.

## What this assumes about the repository

Two settings live in GitHub's configuration, not in this repository's files. **This PR
does not configure either of them**; both should be set by a repository administrator.

**A tag-protection ruleset on `v*`,** restricting who may create a release tag to the
authorized release maintainers. This is the other half of the ancestry check, and the
halves are not interchangeable. A tag push runs the workflow file *as it exists at the
tagged commit*, so a crafted commit could carry a `release.yml` with the ancestry check
removed. What such a workflow cannot do is obtain the npm credential — that requires
declaring the `release` environment and satisfying its protection rules. So: the ruleset
constrains **who** may create a release tag, the preflight ancestry check constrains
**what commit** an honest tag may release, and the environment boundary constrains
**what any workflow can reach**. Each covers a case the others do not.

**A GitHub Environment named `release`,** holding `NPM_TOKEN` as an environment secret
— not a repository secret. That distinction is the boundary: a repository secret is
reachable from any job in any workflow, while an environment secret is handed only to a
job that names the environment and passes its protection rules. Required reviewers on
that environment are worth enabling; they are the one control a workflow file cannot
route around.

## npm authentication — temporary, and known to be

Publication currently authenticates with a **granular npm access token** stored as
`NPM_TOKEN` in the `release` environment. It should be scoped to the `dropin-miner`
package alone, with publish capability and no unrelated package or organisation
authority, and with a finite expiry.

**This is a bridge, not the destination.** npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) is the intended
replacement: it removes the long-lived credential entirely, and it is not implemented
here because package-side OIDC authorization is not yet available to this project.
Nothing about it is implemented or half-implemented — when it becomes available, the
change is confined to the `publish-npm` job's authentication. Preflight, release
ordering, artifact verification, propagation handling, smoke verification and the retry
semantics are all independent of how that one job authenticates, which is why they are
separate jobs.

Until then: **the token expires and must be rotated.** A release that fails in
`publish-npm` with an authentication error, after everything before it passed, is the
expiry — rotate the token in the `release` environment and re-run; the run will resume
past the completed GitHub Release. Never commit token material, and never add the secret
to a job that does not publish.

## The npm version, and the two releases that got it wrong

The rule is that the tagged commit already carries `npm/package.json` at the version
being tagged. The run of tags that actually holds it is v0.1.1 through v0.2.0, then
v0.2.3 through v0.2.7 — v0.2.1 and v0.2.2 are the two that broke it, and they are why
preflight checks it. `v0.2.1`'s commit still said `0.2.0`; `v0.2.2`'s still said
`0.2.1`. The bump landed a commit late twice running, and nothing in CI noticed either
time.

Before v0.2.7 the bump was done by hand, sometimes as its own commit (e.g. "npm 0.1.4"),
sometimes folded into whatever feature commit happened to be the release point.
**Beginning with v0.2.7 it gets a dedicated `release/x.y.z` PR of its own**, so the
version is never a line buried in a feature diff and the commit to tag is unambiguous.
The earlier shape is history, not a mistake to rewrite.

Miss the bump and the GitHub Release still builds fine — goreleaser doesn't look at
`npm/package.json` at all. That is precisely why the check is where it is: the failure
is silent on the side that gets watched, and shows up later in the npm package, where it
stays stale until someone notices.

## Manually verifying install.ps1

Not covered by CI, and **not covered by the release workflow either**: `ci.yml`'s
Windows runner does `go vet`/`go test`/`go build` only, and `release.yml`'s Windows
smoke job installs the npm package, which is a different path. `install.ps1` downloads
a real GitHub release over a real network call to `api.github.com`, not something worth
building a CI stub for one script. `setup.sh`'s equivalent behavior (the config it
writes, ending with a mining decision on file) has an automated test that actually runs
it, `cmd/dropin-miner/installer_test.go`; `install.ps1` has no PowerShell equivalent
yet.

After cutting a release, run it once by hand (a real Windows machine, or `pwsh`
elsewhere — the script is plain PowerShell; the CIM processor-architecture query is its
only genuinely Windows-only line):

1. `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twilight-project/dropin-miner/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex`
   against a scratch `$env:TOKENDROP_HOME`.
2. Confirm the checksum step actually ran: a deliberately wrong `checksums.txt`
   should throw, not silently pass.
3. Confirm the written `tokendrop.toml` has `[platform]`/`[mining]`/`[miner]`
   blocks, and no unconditional `enabled = true` under `[mining]` unless
   `TOKENDROP_MINING=1` was set with input redirected.
4. Confirm `connect` actually ran: a claim URL printed, and
   `dropin-miner status` afterward showing the registration it made.

## What this doesn't cover

`npm/package.json`'s version tracking the GitHub release tag 1:1 is the release
invariant this document asserts, not merely a pattern it noticed. That is a change from
how this section used to read: it recorded "six-for-six is the pattern that exists" and
declined to call it a rule, and the history has since stopped being six-for-six.
v0.2.1's tagged commit shipped `0.2.0` and v0.2.2's shipped `0.2.1` — two misses, both
documented above, neither caught by anything. An invariant nobody stated is one nobody
checks, which is exactly how it was broken twice running. It is now checked before
anything is built. If 1:1 tracking is not actually the intent — if the wrapper should
version independently — then this document is wrong and should change, and the check
should go with it.

Still outside the automation, deliberately:

- **The version bump itself.** CI does not commit to this repository. The number belongs
  in a reviewed commit.
- **Which commit gets released.** The whole design boundary.
- **`install.ps1`**, above.
- **Pi and Hermes live-host smokes**, which need real hosts and are not release
  engineering.

And one thing the workflow cannot prove about itself: a tag-triggered workflow only ever
runs the version of itself that exists at the tagged commit, so changes to `release.yml`
are exercised for the first time by the next real release. There is no way to rehearse a
tag push without pushing a tag.
