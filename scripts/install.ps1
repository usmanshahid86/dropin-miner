# dropin-miner bootstrap for Windows.
#
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twilight-project/dropin-miner/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
#
# Downloads the latest release for this machine, verifies its checksum,
# installs it under $HOME\.tokendrop\bin, and hands off to
# `dropin-miner.exe setup`: it restricts the installation directory to you,
# writes the config, runs `connect` (registration, the mining question in
# this window, a wallet if you want one), puts the binary on your USER PATH
# and sets TOKENDROP_CONFIG, and offers the coding agents it finds. No
# enrollment token to generate, no key to paste, no join to run by hand.
#
# A binary from before setup moved into it (v0.2.8 and older) has no `setup`
# command. The capability is probed, never assumed from a version: when
# `dropin-miner.exe setup -h` does not exit 0, this script's own config,
# PATH and connect steps run instead, exactly as they did before.
#
# TOKENDROP_INSTALL_BIN=<path> skips the download and uses that binary
# (air-gapped installs, and the installer's own tests).
#
# Never elevates. Writes only under $HOME and the user's own environment.

Installed and connected.

  1. If a claim URL was printed above and nobody has visited it yet, do
     that whenever you're ready - nothing else here depends on timing it.
     Once claimed, mining (if you said yes) enrolls and declares a payout
     on its own, from the next search.
  2. dropin-miner agents install     (writes a skill + hooks for the coding
                                       agents found on this machine)
  3. Restart any open agent, then search as usual.
  4. Check in any time: dropin-miner status / doctor / payout show

Cursor and Claude Code run shell commands through PowerShell or Git Bash;
both find dropin-miner on PATH after the next sign-in.
