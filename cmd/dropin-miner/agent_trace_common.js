// dropin-miner: shared trace preparation for the JavaScript hosts.
//
// ONE source of truth. Every host whose lineage channel is a JavaScript or
// TypeScript artifact we install — opencode's in-process plugin, Pi's
// auto-discovered extension — is RENDERED from its own template with this
// file spliced in where that template carries the trace-common marker
// (renderAgentScript in agents.go). The installed files stay standalone,
// with no import of ours to resolve at runtime and no package manager in
// the picture, but the scrub and the caps below exist exactly once in the
// repository.
//
// That is the point. A second, weaker copy of this logic in a second
// adapter is the failure this file exists to prevent: the adapter is what
// builds the bridge, so an adapter that scrubs late — or not at all — puts
// raw assistant text into a process argument before the Go binary ever
// sees it. The order here is not negotiable:
//
//	complete bounded source -> scrub -> UTF-8 byte accounting ->
//	32 KiB history tail -> envelope -> 48 KiB envelope check -> base64url
//
// Never truncate before scrubbing: a slice can cut a secret in half and
// leave both halves unrecognizable to the redactor. An entry too large to
// scrub whole is omitted whole instead.
//
// Everything here fails open. A host adapter that throws leaves the tool
// call exactly as it found it and the search runs with its per-shell
// trace, which is the whole fallback contract: tracing must never be the
// reason a search does not run.
import { createHash } from "node:crypto"

// The trace hash: domain-separated SHA-256 over a PUBLIC prefix, truncated
// to 16 bytes and hex-encoded — the same derivation as traceHash in
// trace.go, so a host id hashed here and one hashed in Go agree. It is not
// keyed and is not a secret: it exists so a stable identifier can leave the
// machine without the host's own id leaving with it.

// declared shell's syntax, and nothing else: a leading NAME=value word in

// another argument, or inside the JSON request body — a query that mentions
// the variable is still just a query. An assignment somewhere this cannot
// prove is standalone leaves the command untouched and no lineage claimed.
//
// The binary cannot authenticate an environment variable, so the client
// trace stays unauthenticated metadata either way; what this protects is
